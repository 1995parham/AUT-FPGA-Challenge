Recently, immediately following invention of a Connect6 game, many game programs were developed aggressively. However, because the solution space of the Connect6 game is extremely large,
the computation powers of current computers are quite insufficient to search all possible solutions. This paper therefore presents a proposal of a field programmable gate array (FPGA) 
Connect6 Solver with a two-stage pipelined evaluation exploiting numerous zero-evaluation functions to evaluate only a zero value and a small number of detailed evaluation functions which
can evaluate all range. The FPGA Connect6 Solver implemented onto a Cyclone IV FPGA is able to defeat target software provided by the 2011 International Conference on Field-Programmable
Technology (ICFPT) within the time limit of 1 s for each turn. In addition, the FPGA Connect6 Solver can defeat another JAVA-based software program with a similar algorithm. 
At that time, the operation speed of the FPGA Connect6 Solver is 764.2 times higher than that of the software operating on a personal computer
(Vostro 220S; Dell Inc.) with a 3.16 GHz, Core 2 Duo processor (Intel Corp.).
